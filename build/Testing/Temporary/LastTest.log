=== RUN  crc32: CRC-32/ISO-HDLC known vectors
---     crc32: known vector '123456789' -> 0xCBF43926
---     crc32: empty input -> 0x00000000
=== OK   crc32 (2 checks)

=== RUN  cobs: COBS encode/decode round-trips
---     cobs: round-trip empty buffer
---     cobs: round-trip without zero bytes
---     cobs: round-trip with embedded zeros
---     cobs: round-trip large non-zero payload (exercises 0xFF blocks)

=== OK   cobs (645 checks)

=== RUN  framer: COBS+CRC framing/deframing

=== RUN  router: Frame parsing + handler dispatch
---     router: buildFrame() + onPacket() dispatches by msg_id
---     router: rejects frames with unexpected version
---     router: rejects frames whose len field mismatches actual payload size
---     router: type-safe handler registration and dispatch
=== OK   router (23 checks)

=== RUN  node: Transport integration end-to-end
---     node: publish() on A -> poll() on B -> handler called with payload+hash
=== OK   node (9 checks)
